# Scanner ignore files

Media folders honor two file-based ignore mechanisms during scans. Series,
movie, audiobook, podcast, ebook, and manga walkers apply these rules to the
paths they discover. Existing library layouts still apply: podcast episodes
must be directly inside a show folder, and audiobook discovery stops below a
book folder containing audio.

## Marker files: `.ignore` and `.nomedia`

A directory containing a plain regular file named `.ignore` or `.nomedia` is
skipped entirely, together with everything under it. The marker must be a
regular file — a directory or symlink named `.ignore` is ordinary content.
The marker means "this folder is not media", so it has no pattern semantics
and cannot be overridden by a deeper `.siloignore`.

## Pattern file: `.siloignore`

A `.siloignore` file holds one glob pattern per line and follows the same
principles as Plex's `.plexignore`:

- The file must be a regular file in the directory it applies to; symlinks
  and directories do not count.
- Patterns are matched against paths relative to the directory holding the
  file.
- The file's patterns apply to that directory and every descendant. Nested
  `.siloignore` files stack on top of the inherited ones; nothing un-inherits
  a parent rule.
- A pattern that matches a directory name prunes the whole subtree, matching
  directories included.
- Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are comments. Surrounding
  whitespace is trimmed.
- Globbing uses Go's `filepath.Match`: `*` matches within one path segment and
  does not cross `/`. A pattern therefore only matches files directly inside
  the directory unless it contains an explicit `/` path, e.g. `Season 2/*.mkv`.

## Scan behavior

- Ignored content simply never appears in walk results. Missing-file
  reconciliation then retires anything previously cataloged there, which is
  the intended outcome of adding an ignore file to an already-scanned folder.
  Existing empty-scan confirmation and file-removal grace policies still
  apply. An ignore marker does not authorize cleanup of an empty library.
- Ignored entries do not count as walk failures. They never suppress
  missing-file reconciliation the way unreadable paths do.
- An unreadable `.siloignore` is treated as absent; a broken ignore file never
  aborts a library walk.
- An explicit single-file scan (`ScanFile`) ignores ignore files: an
  explicitly requested file is scanned even if a pattern would exclude it.
  For audiobooks, this rebuilds the containing book as a whole.
- Subtree folder scans inherit markers and patterns from their configured
  library root through the subtree's ancestors. Rules outside the configured
  root do not apply. If an ancestor directory cannot be read, the subtree is
  protected from missing-file reconciliation.
